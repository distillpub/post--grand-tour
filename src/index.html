  The Grand Tour<d-cite key="asimov1985grand"></d-cite> is a classic visualization technique for high-dimensional point clouds that <em>projects</em> a high-dimensional dataset into two dimensions.

  Over time, the Grand Tour smoothly animates its projection so that every possible view of the dataset is (eventually) presented to the viewer.

  Unlike modern nonlinear projection methods such as t-SNE<d-cite key="maaten2008visualizing"></d-cite> and UMAP<d-cite key="mcinnes2018umap"></d-cite>, the Grand Tour is fundamentally a <em>linear</em> method.

  In this article, we show how to leverage the linearity of the Grand Tour to enable a number of capabilities that are uniquely useful to visualize the behavior of neural networks.
  
  <!-- Although this means that each offers unique properties in the visualization of the behavior of neural networks. -->
  
  <!-- Because the Grand Tour is fundamentally a <em>linear</em> method, the patterns it shows more directly correspond to patterns of interest in the neural network. -->
  
  Concretely, we present three use cases of interest: visualizing the training process as the network weights change, visualizing the layer-to-layer behavior as the data goes through the network and visualizing both how adversarial examples<d-cite key="szegedy2013intriguing"></d-cite> are crafted and how they fool a neural network.
  
  <!-- The Grand Tour works by generating a random, smoothly changing rotation of the dataset, and then projecting it to 2D. -->
  <!-- With the Grand Tour, user interaction is easy to incorporate, allowing a natural mixed-initiative mode of visual exploration. -->
  <!-- In the figure above, we use the Grand Tour to display how 1000 images activate the final softmax layer of a 10-class neural network classifier. -->
  <!-- The point color represents the true class of each image. -->
  <!-- Unlike other methods, the Grand Tour offers good consistency with respect to changes in the data, allowing the visualization of training dynamics of a neural network. -->

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Deep neural networks often achieve best-in-class performance in supervised learning contests such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)<d-cite key="ILSVRC15"></d-cite>.
  
  Unfortunately, their decision process is notoriously hard to interpret<d-cite key="lipton2016mythos"></d-cite>, and their training process is often hard to debug<d-cite key="wongsuphasawat2018visualizing"></d-cite>.
  
  In this article, we present a method to visualize the responses of a neural network which leverages properties of deep neural networks and properties of the <em>Grand Tour</em>.

  Notably, our method enables us to more directly reason about the relationship between <em>changes in the data</em> and <em>changes in the resulting visualization</em><d-cite key="kindlmann2014algebraic"></d-cite>.

  As we will show, this data-visual correspondence is central to the method we present, especially when compared to other non-linear projection methods like UMAP and t-SNE.
</p>

  <!-- The Grand Tour works by generating a random, smoothly changing rotation of the dataset, and then projecting the data to the two-dimensional screen. Notably, this is a <em>linear</em> process. -->
  <!-- This linearity is particularly useful  -->
  <!-- This linearity is particularly useful when visualizing afor visualizing deep neural networks because, as we will see, the linear transformations in neural networks can be simplified in the Grand Tour. -->
  
</p>

<p>
  To understand a neural network, we often try to observe its action on input examples (both real and synthesized)<d-cite key="olah2017feature"></d-cite>.
  
  These kinds of visualizations are useful to elucidate the activation patterns of a neural network for a single example, but they might offer less insight about the relationship between different examples, different states of the network as it's being trained, or how the data in the example flows through the different layers of a single network.
  
  Therefore, we instead aim to enable visualizations of the <em>context around</em> our objects of interest: what is the difference between the present training epoch and the next one? How does the classification of a network converge (or diverge) as the image is fed through the network?

  Linear methods are attractive because they are particularly easy to reason about.

  The Grand Tour works by generating a random, smoothly changing rotation of the dataset, and then projecting the data to the two-dimensional screen: both are linear processes.

  Although deep neural networks are clearly not linear processes, they often confine their nonlinearity to a small set of operations, enabling us to still reason about their behavior.

  Our proposed method better preserves context by providing more
  consistency: it should be possible to know <em>how the visualization
  would change, if the data had been different in a particular
  way</em>.
</p>

<h2>Working Examples</h2>

<p>
  To illustrate the technique we will present, we trained deep neural
  network models (DNNs) with 3 common image classification datasets:
  MNIST
  <d-footnote>

  </d-footnote>

  and CIFAR-10
  <d-footnote>
    CIFAR-10<d-cite key="krizhevsky2009cifar10"></d-cite> contains RGB images of 10 classes of objects

  </d-footnote>. 
  While our architecture is simpler and smaller than current DNNs, it's still indicative of modern networks, and is complex enough to demonstrate both our proposed techniques and shortcomings of typical approaches.
</p>


<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Perhaps the next question is: were these late learning caused by some outliers in the dataset or it is a feature for all 1s or 7s? -->
<!--   To explore this we need to break the per-class losses further down to individual input examples. -->
<!--   <\!-- TODO smoother transition -\-> -->
<!--   But instead of looking at losses, we can directly look at the softmax activations.  -->
<!--   The softmax layer has 10 neurons that can be seen as the (predicted) probability, one for each class.  -->
<!--   Together these 10 neurons can also be seen as a 10-vector, which will become useful later. -->
<!--   We expect, for example, that the 7th (0-indexed) neuron fired up for hand written 7s. -->
<!--   In fact, since we have access to not only the softmax but also all hidden layers, we can probe the network with input examples to see how it reacts on <em>each</em> layer. -->
<!--   In this way we are trying to open the "black box" and understand the internal of a neural network. -->
<!--   Here is a typical view of the opened box: -->
    <!-- </p> -->

<p class='caption'>Neural network opened. The colored blocks are building-block functions (i.e. neural network layers), the gray-scale heatmaps are either the input image or intermediate activation vectors after some layers.</p>
   
<p>
  Even though neural networks are capable of incredible feats of classification, deep down, they really are just pipelines of relatively simple functions.
  For images, the input is a 2D array of scalar values for gray scale images or RGB triples for colored images.
  When needed, one can always flatten the 2D array into an equivalent (<d-math>w \cdot h \cdot c</d-math>) -dimensional vector.
  Similarly, the intermediate values after any one of the functions in composition, or activations of neurons after a layer, can also be seen as vectors in <d-math>\mathbb{R}^n</d-math>, where <d-math>n</d-math> is the number of neurons in the layer. 
  The softmax, for example, can be seen as a 10-vector whose values are positive real numbers that sum up to 1.
  This vector view of data in neural network not only allows us represent complex data in a mathematically compact form, but also hints us on how to visualize them in a better way.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the simple functions fall into two categories: they are either linear transformations of their inputs (like fully-connected layers or convolutional layers), or relatively simple non-linear functions that work component-wise (like sigmoid activations<d-footnote>
    Sigmoid calculates <d-math>S(x)=\frac{e^{x}}{e^{x}+1}</d-math> for each entry (<d-math>x</d-math>) in a vector input. Graphically, it is an S-shaped curve.

  or ReLU activations).
  Some operations, notably max-pooling<d-footnote>
    Max-pooling calculates maximum of a region in the input. For example
    <!-- <img src="figs/maxpool.png" style="width:60%" class="img-center">

  </d-footnote> and softmax, do not fall into either categories. We will come back to this later.
  <!-- This categorization into "linear or componentwise" will be essential to untangle the internal workings of the neural network. -->
  <!-- Decomposing the whole pipeline into simpler functions gives details about what happened inside, in particular how neurons activate in different layers. -->
</p>

<p>
  The above figure helps us look at a single image at a time; however, it does not provide much context to understand the relationship between layers, between different examples, or between different class labels. For that, researchers often turn to more sophisticated visualizations.
</p>


<h2>Using Visualization to Understand DNNs</h2>

<p>
  Let's start by considering the problem of visualizing the training process of a DNN.
  When training neural networks, we optimize parameters in the function to minimize a scalar-valued loss function, typically through some form of gradient descent.
  We want the loss to keep decreasing, so we monitor the whole history of training and testing losses over rounds of training (or "epochs"), to make sure that the loss decreases over time. 
  The following figure shows a line plot of the training loss for the MNIST classifier.
</p>

<d-figure class='lh' style="">
  <svg id='lh' height=300 style='width: 100%; height: 300px;'></svg>
  <script src='js/lh.js'></script>
</d-figure>

<p>
  Although its general trend meets our expectation as the loss steadily decreases, we see something strange around epochs 14 and 21: the curve goes almost flat before starting to drop again.
  What happened? What caused that?
</p>

<d-figure class='lh-per-class' style="">
  <svg id='lh-per-class' height=300 style='width: 100%; height: 300px;'></svg>
  <script src='js/lh-per-class.js'></script>
</d-figure>

<p>
  If we separate input examples by their true labels/classes and plot the <em>per-class</em> loss like above, we see that the two drops were caused by the classses 1 and 7; the model learns different classes at very different times in the training process. 
  Although the network learns to recognize digits 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 early on, it is not until epoch 14 that it starts successfully recognizing digit 1, or until epoch 21 that it recognizes digit 7.
  If we knew ahead of time to be looking for class-specific error rates, then this chart works well. But what if we didn't really know what to look for?
</p>

<!-- <p>
  TODO NEED THIS LATER?
  In a neural network, it must be the effect of non-linear functions that cause its classification power, because linear methods are fundamentally limited in their predictive ability (CITE VC-DIMENSION).
  However, notice that in neural networks, the non-linearities are in fact easy to understand because they tend to operate component-wise: in effect, one coordinate does not influence another.
  On the other hand, linear layers <em>combine many coordinates</em> in their computation, making the overall behavior hard to understand in terms of the numbers being passed around.
  In linear mappings, the activation of one neuron is potentially distributed to every neuron of the next layer.
  In order to understand the behavior of a linear map, we have to think of all neurons in one layer as a whole.
  In a sense, then, it is the <em>linear</em> parts of a neural network that need most help from visualization.
</p> -->

<p>
  In that case, we could consider visualizations of neuron activations (e.g. in the last softmax layer) for <em>all</em> examples at once, looking
  to find patterns like class-specific behavior, and other patterns besides.
  Should there be only two neurons in that layer, a simple two-dimensional scatter plot would work.
  However, the points in the softmax layer for our example datasets are 10 dimensional (and in larger-scale classification problems this number can be much larger).
  We need to either show two dimensions at a time (which does not scale well as the number of possible charts grows quadratically),
  or we can use <em>dimensionality reduction</em> to map the data into a two dimensional space and show them in a single plot. 
</p>

<i id="sm0-a"></i>
<h3>The State-of-the-art Dimensionality Reduction is Non-linear</h3>
<p>
  Modern dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are capable of impressive feats of summarization, providing two-dimensional images where similar points tend to be clustered together very effectively.
  However, these methods are not particularly good to understand the behavior of neuron activations at a fine scale.
  Consider the aforementioned intriguing feature about the different learning rate that the MNIST classifier has on digit 1 and 7: the network did not learn to recognize digit 1 until epoch 14, digit 7 until epoch 21.
  We compute t-SNE, Dynamic t-SNE<d-cite key="rauber2016visualizing"></d-cite>, and UMAP projections of the epochs where the phenomenon we described happens.
  Consider now the task of identifying this class-specific behavior during training. As a reminder, in this case, the strange behavior happens with digits 1 and 7, around epochs 14 and 21 respectively.
  While the behavior is not particularly subtle&emdash;digit goes from misclassified to correctly classified&emdash; it is quite hard to notice it in any of the plots below. 
  Only on careful inspection we can notice that (for example) in the UMAP plot, the digit 1 which clustered in the bottom in epoch 13 becomes a new tentacle-like feature in epoch 14.

<p>
  One reason that non-linear embeddings fail in elucidating this phenomenon is that, for the particular change in the data, the fail the principle of <em>data-visual correspondence</em> <d-cite key="kindlmann2014algebraic"></d-cite>. More concretely, the principle states that specific visualization tasks should be modeled as functions that change the data; the visualization sends this change from data to visuals, and
  we can study the extent to which the visualization changes are easily perceptible.
  Ideally, we want the changes in data and visualization to <em>match in magnitude</em>: a barely noticeable change in visualization should be due to the smallest possible change in data, and a salient change in visualization should reflect a significant one in data.
  Here, a significant change happened in only a <em>subset</em> of data (e.g. all points of digit 1 from epoch 13 to 14), but <em>all</em> points in the visualization move dramatically.
  For both UMAP and t-SNE, the position of each single point depends non-trivially on the whole data distribution in such embedding algorithms.
  This property is not ideal for visualization because it fails the data-visual correspondence, making it hard to <em>infer</em> the underlying change in data from the change in the visualization.
</p>

<p>
  Non-linear embeddings that have non-convex objectives also tend to be sensitive to initial conditions.
  For example, in MNIST, although the neural network starts to stabilize on epoch 30, t-SNE and UMAP still generate quite different projections between epochs 30, 31, 32, and 33 (in fact, all the way to 99).
  Temporal regularization techniques (such as Dynamic t-SNE<d-cite key="rauber2016visualizing"></d-cite>) mitigate these consistency issues, but still suffer from other interpretability issues<d-cite key="wattenberg2016use"></d-cite>.

</d-figure>

<p>
  Now, let's consider another task, that of identifying classes which the neural network tends to confuse.
  For this example, we will use the Fashion-MNIST dataset and classifier, and consider the confusion among sandals, sneakers and ankle boots.
  If we know ahead of time that these three classes are likely to confuse the classifier, then we can directly design an appropriate linear projection, as can be seen in the last row of the following figure (we found this particular projection using both the Grand Tour and the direct manipulation technique we later describe). The pattern in this case is quite salient, forming a triangle.
  T-SNE, in contrast, incorrectly separates the class clusters (possibly because of an inappropriately-chosen hyperparameter).
  UMAP successfully isolates the three classes, but even in this case it's not possible to distinguish between three-way confusion for the classifier in epochs 5 and 10 (portrayed in a linear method by the presence of points near the center of the triangle), and multiple two-way confusions in later epochs (evidences by an "empty" center).

<!-- <p>
  In addition, we use this section to highlight a current shortcoming of our present technique, namely that it only allows the visualization of a <em>single</em> projection.
  With multiple plots, we can use <em>linked brushing and multiple views</em>.
  This technique allows users to build an intuitive understanding of the projections by selecting points in one region of a plot and observing which points are highlighted on the other projections.
  </p> -->


<h2>Linear Methods to the Rescue</h2>

<p>
  When given the chance, then, we should prefer methods for which changes in the data produce predictable, visually salient changes in the result, and linear dimensionality reductions often have this property.
  <!-- They are more interpretable than non-linear methods due to a good data-visual correspondence. -->
<!-- </p> -->
<!-- <p> -->
  Here, we revisit the linear projections described above in an interface where the user can easily navigate between different training epochs.
  In addition, we introduce another useful capability which is only available to linear methods, that of direct manipulation.
  Each linear projection from $n$ dimensions to $2$ dimensions can be represented by $n$ 2-dimensional vectors which have an intuitive interpretation: they are the vectors that the $n$ canonical basis vector in the $n$-dimensional space will be projected to.
  In the context of projecting the final classification layer, this is especially simple to interpret: they are the destinations of an input that is classified with 100% confidence to any one particular class.
  If we provide the user with the ability to change these vectors by dragging around user-interface handles, then users can intuitively set up new linear projections.
</p>

<p>  
  This setup provides additional nice properties that explain the salient patterns in the previous illustrations.
  For example, because projections are linear and the coefficients of vectors in the classification layer sum to one, classification outputs that are halfway confident between two classes are projected to vectors that are halfway between the class handles.
  <!-- Direct manipulation handles are not only for <em>exploratory</em> visual analysis, they are also friendly for <em>explanatory</em> visualizations/presentations.  -->
  <!-- To illustrate the late learning of digit 1 and 7 in the MNIST classifier, for example, we find and recorded the following linear projection which project the first and and seventh axis on top of the canvas.  -->
  <!-- Without much difficulty, we can convince the viewers that digit 1 and 7 get classified correctly starting from epoch 14 and 21, thanks to the good data-visual correspondence in the Grand Tour/linear projections.  -->

  Examples falling between classes indicate that the model has trouble distinguishing the two, such as sandals vs. sneakers, and sneakers vs. ankle boot classes. 
  Note, however, that this does not happen as much for sandals vs. ankle boots: not many examples fall between these two classes. 
  Moreover, most data points are projected close to the edge of the triangle. 
  This tells us that most confusions happen between two out of the three classes, they are really two-way confusions.

  Within the same dataset, we can also see pullovers, coats and shirts filling a triangular <em>plane</em>.
  This is different from the sandal-sneaker-ankle-boot case, as examples not only fall on the boundary of a triangle, but also in its interior: a true three-way confusion. 

  Similarly, in the CIFAR-10 dataset we can see confusion between dogs and cats, airplanes and ships.
  The mixing pattern in CIFAR-10 is not as clear as in fashion-MNIST, because many more examples are misclassified.

<h2>The Grand Tour</h2>

<p>
  In the previous section, we took advantage of the fact that we knew which classes to visualize.
  That meant it was easy to design linear projections for the particular tasks at hand.
  But what if we don't know ahead of time which projection to choose from, because we don't quite know what to look for?
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the quintessential linear dimensionality reduction method,
  choosing to project the data so as to preserve the most variance possible. 
  However, the distribution of data in softmax layers often has similar variance along many axis directions, because each axis concentrates a similar number of examples around the class vector.<d-footnote>We are assuming a class-balanced training dataset. Nevertheless, if the training dataset is not balanced, PCA will prefer dimensions with more examples, which might not help much either.</d-footnote>
  As a result, even though PCA projections are interpretable and consistent through training epochs, the first two principal components of softmax activations are not substantially better than the third.
  So which of them should we choose?
  <!-- To make matters worse, different principal components are orthogonal to each other, making it hard for the user to keep them all in their head at once. -->
  <!-- Random projections alleviate this issue but it is hard to link between many random projections and assure the quality of each of them. -->
  Instead of PCA, we propose to visualize this data by smoothly animating random projections, using a technique called the Grand Tour<d-cite key="asimov1985grand"></d-cite>.
</p>

<p>
Starting with a random velocity, it smoothly rotates data points around the origin in high dimensional space, and then projects it down to 2D for display. 
Here are some examples of how Grand Tour acts on some (low-dimensional) objects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>On a square, the Grand Tour rotates it with a constant angular velocity.</li> 
<li>On a cube, the Grand Tour rotates it in 3D, and its 2D projection let us see every facet of the cube. </li>
<li>On a 4D cube (a <em>tesseract</em>), the rotation happens in 4D and the 2D view shows every possible projection.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p class='caption'>The Grand Tour of the softmax layer. Drag the handle on each axis to move that axis.</p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   When combined with interactive components such as sliders, data filters and direct manipulations, we can quickly find projections that reveals important patterns in the data.  -->
<!--   In the above view we can click on legends, drag sliders and move the circular handle on each axis to (re)discover the late learning of digit 1 or 7 in MNIST, or the three-way confusion in Fashion-MNIST. -->
<!--   But see how much easier this time than previous non-linear methods. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Now, let us take a closer look at the Grand Tour technique itself. -->
<!-- </p> -->


<!-- <p>
  Although with the Grand Tour we have observed interesting phenomenon, there are other ways of looking at the same kind of data. 
  For example, the
  <d-cite key="ren2017squares">Squares</d-cite>
  visualizes the softmax layer using parallel coordinates. 
  However, one draw back of using parallel coordinates is that it does not emphasize the spatial relation among multiple dimensions. 
  What makes it not ideal, is that the order of different dimension is predetermined so that any non-neighboring dimensions are hard to compare and correlate. 
  In our use case, where relation among dimensions are of the greatest interest, parallel coordinates would not provide an straightforward view of multi-way confusions among classes. 
</p> -->


<!-- this fails at providing an overview among all instances-->
<!-- <p>Similar illustrations exist, for example, by <d-cite key="harley2015isvc">Harley</d-cite>, where activations are arranged in a 2D or 3D canvas</p> -->
<!-- <p>
Mathematically, a neural network can be represented as a function. 
To make a neural network well modularized and easy to build and train, internally the mathematical function is composed by multiple simpler building-block functions, which are often called layers in neural network context. Such building-block functions serve different purposes. 
The labels on each colored rectangle denote what kind of building-block functions were used in our network. 
When an example image were passed through the network, each building-block function transforms the image to a different numerical representation and as the functions works in a chain, the image is transformed from one representation to another. 
The representations can be in the form of a scale, vector or tensor. 
In the diagram above, we illustrated some of these representations by gray-scale heatmaps. The whiter a pixel is, the larger value stored in the corresponding entry. To better use the drawing space, we reshaped these representation closer to squares.
A worth noting representation is the 10-vector produced in the last <em>softmax</em>layer. 
In this layer, the networks is trained to represent an one-hot encoding of the image class label, so normally only the entry corresponding to the true class of the image are fired up. 
For example, a digit 0 should have a white spot in the first column, first row. 
A digit 1 image should fire up the cell in first column, second row.
</p>
<p>
  One nice property of the softmax layer is that each entries are non-negative and the sum of them equals to 1. This property gives us an attractive interpretation of this layer - for any given image, the final softmax layer represents the <em>confidence</em> of the network about this image belonging to each class. In stead of looking at one image at a time, we would like to see their <em>distribution</em> in this nice interpretable softmax layer. 
  To see how this 10-vector is activated by the <em>set</em> of images, we turned to an old technique called the Grand Tour to reveal spatial relations among dimensions.
</p> -->

<!-- <h3>The Grand Tour</h3> -->

<!-- <p>
  Mathematically, the Grand Tour provides us a sequence of <d-math>p-dimensional</d-math> to 2D projections, which can be represented by a function from a time variable <d-math>t</d-math> to p-by-2 matrices. 
  The p-by-2 matrices can be seen as a composition of a p-by-p orthogonal matrix, <d-math>GT \in SO(p)</d-math>, followed by a simple projection <d-math>\pi_2</d-math> that picks up the first two coordinates of p-dimensional vectors:
  <d-math block>
    t \mapsto \pi_2 \circ GT 
  </d-math>
  We will need the above detail for direct manipulation in <a href="#technical-details">technical details</a>.
</p> -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!--   For more details about the Grand Tour, we recommend curious readers to consult the original paper by Asimov<d-cite key="asimov1985grand"></d-cite>. -->
<!-- </p> -->


<!-- <p> -->
<!--   We have to emphasize one favorable property of the Grand Tour in visualizing neural networks:  -->
<!--   it is invariant about the (orthonormal) basis chosen for the data representation.  -->
<!--   Because the Grand Tour itself is a change of basis, every solid rotation in data space has a corresponding Grand Tour matrix that result in the same view.  -->
<!--   In the mean time, linear transformations in neural networks are also invariant under change of basis.  -->
<!--   Every linear transformations can be uniquely decomposed as a three-step action: rotation, projection followed by another rotation<d-cite key="austin2009svd"></d-cite>. -->
<!--   We will later show that this connection suggests a way to simplify all linear transformations in the neural networks when viewing it in the Grand Tour.  -->
<!-- </p> -->

<h3>The Grand Tour of the Softmax Layer</h3>
<p>
  We first look at the Grand Tour of the softmax layer. 
  The softmax layer is relatively easy to understand because its axes have strong semantics. As we described earlier, the <d-math>i</d-math>-th axis corresponds to network's <em>confidence</em> about predicting that the given input belongs to the<d-math>i</d-math>-th class. 
  <!-- With this nice semantics, direct manipulations with axis handles come more handy. -->
  <!-- For other intermediate layers, the axes are more abstract so we deployed another technique which we will see shortly. -->

</p>

<p>
  The Grand Tour of the softmax layer lets us qualitatively assess the performance of our model.
  In the particular case of this article, since we used comparable architectures for three datasets, this also allows us to gauge the relative difficulty of classifying each dataset. 
  We can see that data points are most confidently classified for the MNIST dataset, where the digits are close to one of the ten corners of the softmax space. For Fashion-MNIST or CIFAR-10, the separation is not as clean, and more points appear <em>inside</em> the volume.
</p>

<!-- <h3>Direct Manipulation on the Axes</h3> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   We will explain how direct manipulation works in <a href="#technical-details">technical details</a>. -->
<!-- </p> -->


<h3>The Grand Tour of Training Dynamics</h3>

<p>
  Linear projection methods naturally give a formulation that is independent of the input points, allowing us to keep the projection fixed while the
  data changes.
  To recap our working example, we trained each of the neural networks for 99 epochs and recorded the entire history of neuron activations on a subset of training and testing examples. We can use the Grand Tour, then, to visualize the actual training process of these networks.
</p>

  <!-- In softmax layer, our neural networks aim to match each image to its 'one-hot' encoding of the corresponding class label. 
  Naturally, if we treat the one-hot encoding as a 10-dimensional vector, in the ideal case we want the neural network cluster instances of <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> class close to coordinate <d-math>e_i = (0,0,\cdots, 0, 1, 0, \cdots)</d-math>, with its <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> coordinate being 1 and 0 elsewhere. 
  As a property of the softmax function we used, no coordinates exceed 1 and all the 10 coordiantes of an instance sum up to 1, so after the softmax function, our points live in a <d-math>10</d-math>-simplex.
  Geometrically this means that we expect a well-trained network map images of one specific class to the corresponding corner of the <d-math>10</d-math>-simplex, as we have mentioned in the teaser figure. 
  We repeated the same figure as below. 
  To interact, you can switch to different datasets from the top menu in the navigation bar, 
  filter images by its class by hovering over and clicking the legend. 
  Dragging the 10 bubble handles at every tip of the ten axes will intervene the rotation. 
  When the Grand Tour glides to or you manually find a good view, it is good to pause the rotation with the button provided on top left and look at how the network trained from that fixed perspective. 
  We also provide a switch to look at the actual images instead of arbitrary points. 
  The image view is best accompanied with an expanded canvas.  -->

<p>
  In the beginning when the neural networks are randomly initialized, all examples are placed around the center of the softmax space, with equal weights to each class. 
  Through training, examples move to class vectors in the softmax space. The Grand Tour also lets us
  compare visualizations of the training and testing data, giving us a qualitative assessment of over-fitting. 
  In the MNIST dataset, the trajectory of testing images through training is consistent with the training set. 
  Data points went directly toward the corner of its true class and all classes are stabilized after about 50 epochs.
  On the other hand, in CIFAR-10 there is an <em>inconsistency</em> between the training and testing sets. Images from the testing set keep oscillating while most images from training converges to the corresponding class corner. 
  In epoch 99, we can clearly see a difference in distribution between these two sets.
  This signals that the model overfits the training set and thus does not generalize well to the testing set.

<h3 name="layer-dynamics">The Grand Tour of Layer Dynamics</h3>
<!-- <p>
  Up till now we have seen the last softmax layer of out neural network model. 
  But what happens to other intermediate layers? Can we look at them in the similar way we did for the last layer? One challenge of looking at intermediate layers, it that axis no longer have a semantic meaning, as in the last layer we know that each of the 10 directions correspond to one of the ten label classes. Another challenge is that directions in two different layers do not align with each other by default. Thus making sense of how the model transforms data points between two consecutive layers is non-trivial.
</p>  --> 

<p>
  Given the presented techniques of the Grand Tour and direct manipulations on the axes, we can in theory visualize and manipulate any intermediate layer of a neural network by itself.  Nevertheless, this is not a very satisfying approach, for two reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the same way that we've kept the projection fixed as the training data changed, we would like to "keep the projection fixed", as the data moves through the layers in the neural network. However, this is not straightforward. For example, different layers in a neural network have different dimensions. How do we connect rotations of one layer to rotations of the other?
    </li>
    <li>
      The class "axis handles" in the softmax layer are convenient, but that's only practical when the dimensionality of the layer is relatively small.
      With hundreds of dimensions, for example, there would be too many axis handles to naturally interact with.
      In addition, hidden layers do not have as clear semantics as the softmax layer, so manipulating them would not be as intuitive.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  To address the first problem, we will need to pay closer attention to the way in which layers transform the data that they are given.  
  To see how a linear transformation can be visualized in a particularly ineffective way, consider the following (very simple) weights (represented by a matrix <d-math>A</d-math>) which take a 2-dimensional hidden layer $k$ and produce activations in another 2-dimensional layer $k+1$. The weights simply negate two activations in 2D:
  <d-math block>
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
    -1, 0 \\
    0, -1
    \end{bmatrix}
  </d-math>
  Imagine that we wish to visualize the behavior of network as the data moves from layer to layer. One way to interpolate the source <d-math>x_0</d-math> and destination <d-math>x_1 = A(x_0) = -x_0</d-math> of this action <d-math>A</d-math> is by a simple linear interpolation

  <d-math block>
  x_t = (1-t) \cdot x_0 + t \cdot x_1 = (1-2t) \cdot x_0    
  </d-math>
  for <d-math>t \in [0,1].</d-math>

  Effectively, this strategy reuses the linear projection coefficients from one layer to the next. This is a natural thought, since they have the same dimension.
  However, notice the following: the transformation given by A is a simple rotation of the data. Every linear transformation of the layer $k+1$ could be encoded simply as a linear transformation of the layer $k$, if only that transformation operated on the negative values of the entries.
  In addition, since the Grand Tour has a rotation itself built-in, for every configuration that gives a certain picture of the layer $k$, there exists a <em>different</em> configuration that would yield the same picture for layer $k+1$, by taking the action of $A$ into account.
  <!-- at the same time (<d-math>t=0.5</d-math>), making it impossible trace individual points.  -->
  <!-- Moreover, this interpolation complicates a simple 180 degree rotation in data. -->
  <!-- In the Grand Tour, matrix <d-math>A</d-math> should be considered doing nearly nothing, for it only rotates the data while the Grand Tour is also a rotation. -->
  <!-- However, when visualizing this by the simple linear interpolation above, all points move dramatically, while the distribution of points (in a coordinate-free space) stays the same. -->
  In effect, the naive interpolation fails the principle of data-visual correspondence: a simple change in data (negation in 2D/180 degree rotation) results in a drastic change in visualization (all points cross the origin).
</p>

<p>
  This observation points to a more general strategy: when designing a visualization, we should be as explicit as possible about which parts of the input (or process) we seek to capture in our visualizations.
  We should seek to explicitly articulate what are purely representational artifacts that we should discard, and what are the real features a visualization we should <em>distill</em> from the representation.
  Here, we claim that rotational factors in linear transformations of neural networks are significantly less important than other factors such as scalings and nonlinearities.
  As we will show, the Grand Tour is particularly attractive in this case because it is can be made to be invariant to rotations in data.
  As a result, the rotational components in the linear transformations of a neural network will be explicitly made invisible.
</p>

<p>
  Concretely, we achieve this by taking advantage of a central theorem of linear algebra. 
  The <em>Singular Value Decomposition</em> (SVD) theorem shows that <em>any</em> linear transformation can be decomposed into a sequence of very simple operations: a rotation, a scaling, and another rotation<d-cite key="austin2009svd"></d-cite>. 

  <!-- (From another perspective, any linear operation in standard bases is a scaling operation with appropriately chosen orthonormal bases on both sides.  -->
  <!-- We will use this perspective later when we discuss what part of the data representation is discarded by the Grand Tour. ) -->
  Applying a matrix <d-math>A</d-math> to a vector <d-math>x</d-math> is then equivalent to applying those simple operations: <d-math>x A = x U \Sigma V^T</d-math>.
  But remember that the Grand Tour works by rotating the dataset and then projecting it to 2D.
  Combined, these two facts mean that as far as the Grand Tour is concerned, visualizing a vector <d-math>x</d-math> is the same as visualizing <d-math>x U</d-math>, and visualizing a vector <d-math>x U \Sigma V^T</d-math> is the same as visualizing <d-math>x U \Sigma</d-math>. 
  This means that any linear transformation seen by the Grand Tour is equivalent to the transition between <d-math>x U</d-math> and <d-math>x U \Sigma</d-math> - a simple (coordinate-wise) scaling. 
  This is explicitly saying that any linear operation (whose matrix is represented in standard bases) is a scaling operation with appropriately chosen orthonormal bases on both sides.
  So the Grand Tour provides a natural, elegant and computationally efficient way to <em>align</em> visualizations of activations separated by fully-connected (linear) layers.<d-footnote>Convolutional layers are also linear. One can instantly see that by forming the linear transformations between flattened feature maps, or by taking the circulant structure of convolutional layers directly into account<d-cite key="sedghi2018singular"></d-cite></d-footnote>
</p>

<p>
  (For the following portion, we reduce the number of data points to 500 and epochs to 50, in order to reduce the amount of data transmitted in a web-based demonstration.)
  With the linear algebra structure at hand, now we are able to trace behaviors and patterns from the softmax back to previous layers.
  In fashion-MNIST, for example, we observe a separation of shoes (sandals, sneakers and ankle boots as a group) from all other classes in the softmax layer. 
  Tracing it back to earlier layers, we can see that this separation happened as early as <a onclick="lt2Figure.onscreen()">layer 5</a>:
</p>
<d-figure class='lt2' style="">
  <canvas id='lt2' class='layertransition'></canvas>
  <script src='js/lt2.js'></script>

<p class='caption'>With layers aligned, it is easy to see the early separation of shoes from <a onclick="
lt2.onDatasetChange('fashion-mnist');
lt2Figure.onscreen();
lt2.overlay.layerPlayButton.on('click')();

<h3>The Grand Tour of Adversarial Dynamics</h3>
<p>
  As a final application scenario, we show how the Grand Tour can also elucidate the behavior of adversarial examples<d-cite key="szegedy2013intriguing"></d-cite> as they are processed by a neural network.
  For this illustration, we use the MNIST dataset, and we adversarially add perturbations to 89 digit 8s to fool the network into thinking they are 0s.
  Previously, we either animated the training dynamics or the layer dynamics.
  We fix a well-trained neural network, and visualize the training process of adversarial examples, since they are often themselves generated by an optimization process. Here, we used the Fast Gradient Sign method.<d-cite key="goodfellow2014explaining"></d-cite>
  Again, because the Grand Tour is a linear method, the change in the positions of the adversarial examples over time can be faithfully attributed to changes in how the neural network perceives the images, rather than potential artifacts of the visualization.
  Let us examine how adversarial examples evolved to fool the network:
</p>
<d-figure class='lta' style="">
  <canvas id='lta' class='layertransition'></canvas>
  <script src='js/lta.js'></script>
</d-figure>
<p class="caption">
  From <a onclick="ltaFigure.onscreen()">this view of softmax</a>, we can see how  
  <span style="color: #444444">adversarial examples</span> 
  evolved from <span style="color: #bcbd22">8s</span> 
  into <span style="color: #1f77b4">0s</span>.
  In the corresponding <a onclick="ltaFigure.onscreen(); lta.overlay.onLayerSliderInput(10);">pre-softmax</a> however, these adversarial examples stop around the decision boundary of two classes. 
  Show data as <a onclick="lta.setMode('image')">images</a> to see the actual images generated in each step, or <a onclick="lta.setMode('point')">dots</a> colored by labels.
</p>

<p>
  Through this adversarial training, the network eventually claims, with high confidence, that the inputs given are all 0s.
  If we stay in the softmax layer and slide though the adversarial training steps in the plot, we can see adversarial examples move from a high score for class 8 to a high score for class 0.
  Although all adversarial examples are classified as the target class (digit 0s) eventually, some of them detoured somewhere close to the centroid of the space (around the 25th epoch) and then moved towards the target. 
  Comparing the actual images of the two groups, we see those that those "detouring" images tend to be noisier.
</p>
<p>
  More interesting, however, is what happens in the intermediate layers.
  In pre-softmax, for example, we see that these <span style="color: #444444; font-weight: 550;">fake 0s</span> behave differently from the <span style="color: #1f77b4; font-weight: 550;">genuine 0s</span>: they live closer to the decision boundary of two classes and form a plane by themselves. 
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<h3>Limitations of the Grand Tour</h3>
<p>
  In the very beginning, we have compared several state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction techniques with the Grand Tour, showing that non-linear methods do not have as many desirable properties as the Grand Tour for understanding the behavior of neural networks. 
  However, the state-of-the-art non-linear methods come with their own strength. 
  Whenever geometry is concerned, like the case of understanding multi-way confusions in the softmax layer, linear methods are more interpretable because they preserve certain geometrical structures of data in the projection.  
  When topology is the main focus, such as when we want to cluster the data or we need dimensionality reduction for downstream geometry-insensitive models, we should prefer non-linear methods such as UMAP or t-SNE for they have more freedom in projecting the data. 
  As we have seen, linear methods become favorable in our case because of its consistency when data changes: in different training epochs or neural network layers, linear methods reveals the change of data without creating extra artifacts, thanks to their linear behavior. 
  But the limitations of the Grand Tour also come from its linear restriction: there may not be a good linear projection that satisfy users' need, such as separating the data.
  For the current state-of-the-art dimensionality reductions, it is more and more possible to combine the best of two worlds. 
  For example, when visualizing adversarial training with the UMAP, it is possible to fit a UMAP embedding with the original dataset and predict the embeddings of adversarial examples. 
</p>

<h3>The Power of Animation and Direct Manipulation</h3>
<p>
  When comparing linear projections with non-linear dimensionality reductions, we used small multiples that go over different training epochs and dimensionality reduction methods. 
  Later when we used the Grand Tour alone, however, we used a single view with animations.
  When comparing small multiples and animations, there is no general conclusion on which one is better than the other in the literature. 
  They are only studied in specific settings, for example, in dynamic graph drawing <d-cite key="archambault2010animation"></d-cite>.
  There has been concerns about the incomparable contents <d-cite key="tversky2002animation"></d-cite> between small multiples and animated plots in some of these studies.
  Despite these concerns, however, the use of animation comes naturally from the direct manipulation in our case.
  Direct manipulation and animation give us opportunities to see, one at a time, all possible projections of the data within a single view, whereas with small multiples we can only select a small sample among infinitely possible projections. 
  Although we could have used small multiples rather than animations for training and layer dynamics, without specific studies supporting that small multiples are significantly better, we choose to corporate all features in a single animated view to keep our visualization minimal and focused.
</p>


<h3>Non-sequential Models</h3>
<p>
  In our work we have walked through models that are purely sequential. 
  In modern architectures it is common to have non-sequential parts such as highway <d-cite key="srivastava2015highway"></d-cite> branches or dedicated branches for different tasks <d-cite key="szegedy2015going"></d-cite>. 
  With our technique, one can visualize neuron activations on each such branch, but more interesting to us in the future is how to visually incorporate multiple branches and interpret much more complex architectures.
</p>


<h3>Scaling to Larger Models</h3>
<p>
  Modern architectures are also wide. Especially when convolutional layers are concerned, one could run into issues with scalability if we see such layers as a large sparse matrix acting on flattened multi-channel images.
  For the sake of simplicity, in this article we brute-forced the computation of the alignment of such convolutional layers by writing out their explicit matrix representation. 
  However, the singular value decomposition of multi-channel 2D convolutions can be computed efficiently <d-cite key="sedghi2018singular"></d-cite>, which can be then be directly used for alignment, as we described above.

In this sections, we will introduce the technical details of direct manipulation and layer transition.

<h3>
Notations
</h3>

<p>
  In this section, our notational convention is that data are represented as row vectors. 
  They form a matrix in which each row is a record and each column is a different feature/dimension.
  As a result, when a linear transformation is applied to the data, the transformation matrix is multiplied on the right of the data matrix.
  This has a side benefit that when applying matrix multiplications in a chain, the formula reads from left to right and aligns with a commutative diagram.
  For example, when a data matrix <d-math>X</d-math> is multiplied by a matrix <d-math>M</d-math> to generate <d-math>Y</d-math>, in formula we write <d-math>XM = Y</d-math>, the letters have the same order in diagram:
</p>

<d-math block>
    X 
    \overset{M}{\mapsto}
    Y
</d-math>

Further, if the SVD of <d-math>M</d-math> is <d-math>M = U \Sigma V^{T}</d-math>, we have <d-math>X U \Sigma V^{T} = Y</d-math>, while the diagram
<d-math block>
    X 
    \overset{U}{\mapsto} <!-- XU  -->
    \overset{\Sigma}{\mapsto} <!-- XU\Sigma  -->
    \overset{V^T}{\mapsto} Y
</d-math>
is nicely aligned with the formula.

Direct Manipulation
</h3>
<div id='div-direct-manipulation' class=''>

<p>
  Our direct manipulations provide direct control over possible projections of data points.
  It can be done either on the axes or on a group of data points. 
  Based on the dimensionality and axis semantics, as discussed in <a href='#layer-dynamics'>Layer Dynamics</a>, we may prefer one mode than the other.
  

  The goal of direct manipulations is to change the linear projection according to user's demand, which is provided by for example mouse dragging. 
  We will see that the axis mode is a special case of data point mode, because we can view an axis handle as a special point on the positive direction of the axis. 
  But because of its simplicity, we will first introduce axis mode.
</p>

<h4 class="clickable clickable-active" onclick="toggle(event, '#div-axis-mode')">
  The Axis Mode
</h4>
<div id='div-axis-mode' class=''>

<p>
  When a user drags an axis handle, he/she wants to move this vector in that direction.
  Since the projection is done by the Grand Tour, the goal is to find a new Grand Tour projection so that the axis follows the user's direction.

  In a nutshell, when user drags the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> axis handle by <d-math>(dx, dy)</d-math>, we add them to the first two entries of the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row of the Grand Tour matrix, and do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process">Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization</a> on the rows of the new matrix
  <d-footnote>
    Rows have to be reordered such that the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row is considered first in the Gram-Schmidt.
  </d-footnote>.
</p>

<p>
  To see why, first, let us formalize the process of the Grand Tour on a standard basis vector <d-math>e_i</d-math>. 
  As shown in the diagram below, <d-math>e_i</d-math> goes through an orthogonal Grand Tour matrix <d-math>GT</d-math> to produce a rotated version of itself, <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math>. 
  Then, <d-math>\pi_2</d-math> is a function that keeps only the first two entries of <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math> and gives the 2D coordinate of the handle to be shown in the plot, <d-math>(x_i, y_i)</d-math>.
</p>

<!-- <img

style="width: 40%"
/> -->
<d-math block>
  e_i \overset{GT}{\mapsto} \tilde{e_i} \overset{\pi_2}{\mapsto} (x_i, y_i)
</d-math>
<p>
  When user drags an axis handle on canvas, he/she induces a delta change <d-math>\Delta = (dx, dy)</d-math>on the xy-plane. 
  The coordinate of the handle becomes:
  <d-math block>(x_i^{(new)}, y_i^{(new)}) := (x_i+dx, y_i+dy)</d-math>
  Note that <d-math>(x_i, y_i)</d-math> is the first two coordinates of the axis handle in high dimension after the Grand Tour rotation, so a delta change on <d-math>(x_i, y_i)</d-math> induces a delta change <d-math>\tilde{\Delta} := (dx, dy, 0, 0, \cdots)</d-math> on <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math>:
  <d-math block>\tilde{e_i} \overset{\tilde{\Delta}}{\mapsto} \tilde{e_i} + \tilde{\Delta}</d-math>
</p>
<p>
  To find a nearby Grand Tour rotation that respects this change, first note that <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math> is exactly the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row of orthogonal Grand Tour matrix <d-math>GT</d-math> 
  <d-footnote>
    Recall that the convention is that vectors are in row forms and linear transformations are matrices that are multiplied on the right.
    So <d-math>e_i</d-math> is a row vector whose <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> is 1 and 0s elsewhere, and <d-math>\tilde{e_i} := e_i \cdot GT</d-math> is the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row of <d-math>GT</d-math>
  </d-footnote>. 
  Naturally, we want the new matrix to be the original <d-math>GT</d-math> with its <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row replaced by <d-math>\tilde{e_i}+\tilde{\Delta}</d-math>, i.e. we should add <d-math>dx</d-math> and <d-math>dy</d-math> to the <d-math>(i,1)</d-math>-th entry and <d-math>(i,2)</d-math>-th entry of <d-math>GT</d-math> respectively:
  <d-math block>\tilde{GT} \leftarrow GT</d-math>
  <d-math block>\tilde{GT}_{i,1} \leftarrow GT_{i,1} + dx</d-math>
  <d-math block>\tilde{GT}_{i,2} \leftarrow GT_{i,2} + dy</d-math>
  However, <d-math>\tilde{GT}</d-math> is not orthogonal for arbitrary <d-math>(dx, dy)</d-math>.
  In order to find an approximation to <d-math>\tilde{GT}</d-math> that is orthogonal, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process">Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization</a> on the rows of <d-math>\tilde{GT}</d-math>, with the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row considered first in the Gram-Schmidt process:
  <d-math block>GT^{(new)} := GramSchmidt(\tilde{GT})</d-math>
  Note that the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row is normalized to a unit vector during the Gram-Schmidt, so the resulting position of the handle is 
  <d-math>\tilde{e_i}^{(new)} = normalize(\tilde{e_i} + \tilde{\Delta})</d-math>
  which may not be exactly the same as <d-math>\tilde{e_i}+\tilde{\Delta}</d-math>, as the following figure shows
  <d-footnote>
    However, for any <d-math>\tilde{\Delta}</d-math>, the norm of the difference is bounded above by <d-math>||\tilde{\Delta}||</d-math>, as the following figure proves.

<h4 class="clickable clickable-active" onclick="toggle(event, '#div-data-point-mode')">
  The Data Point Mode
</h4>
<div id='div-data-point-mode' class=''>
<p>
  We now explain how we directly manipulate data points. 
  Technically speaking, this method only considers one point at a time.
  For a group of points, we compute their centroid and directly manipulate this single point with this method.
  Thinking more carefully about the process in axis mode gives us a way to drag any single point.
  Recall that in axis mode, we added user's manipulation <d-math>\tilde{\Delta} := (dx, dy, 0, 0, \cdots)</d-math> to the position of the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> axis handle <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math>.
  This induces a delta change in the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math> row of the Grand Tour matrix <d-math>GT</d-math>.
  Next, as the first step in Gram-Schmidt, we normalized this row: 
  <d-math block>
    GT_i^{(new)} := normalize(\tilde{GT}_i) = normalize(\tilde{e_i} + \tilde{\Delta})
  </d-math>
  These two steps make the axis handle move from <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math> to <d-math>\tilde{e_i}^{(new)} := normalize(\tilde{e_i}+\tilde{\Delta})</d-math>.
</p>
<p>
  Looking at the geometry of this movement, the "add-delta-then-normalize" on <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math> is equivalent to a <em>rotation</em> from <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math> towards <d-math>\tilde{e_i}^{(new)}</d-math>, illustrated in the figure below. 
  This geometric interpretation can be directly generalized to any arbitrary data point.
</p>
<img src="figs/direct-manipulation-rotation-3d.png" style="width: 65%" class="img-center"/>
<p>
  The figure shows the case in 3D, but in higher dimensional space it is essentially the same, since the two vectors <d-math>\tilde{e_i}</d-math> and <d-math>\tilde{e_i}+\tilde{\Delta}</d-math> only span a 2-subspace.
  Now we have a nice geometric intuition about direct manipulation: dragging a point induces a <em>simple rotation</em>
  <d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotations_in_4-dimensional_Euclidean_space#Simple_rotations">Simple rotations</a> are rotations with only one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_rotation#Simple_rotations">plane of rotation</a>.</d-footnote>
  in high dimensional space.
  This intuition is precisely how we implemented our direct manipulation on arbitrary data points, which we will specify as below.
</p>
<p>
  Generalizing this observation from axis handle to arbitrary data point, we want to find the rotation that moves the centroid of a selected subset of data points <d-math>\tilde{c}</d-math> to 
  <d-math block>
    \tilde{c}^{(new)} := (\tilde{c} + \tilde{\Delta}) \cdot ||\tilde{c}|| / ||\tilde{c} + \tilde{\Delta}||
  </d-math>
</p>
<img src="figs/direct-manipulation-rotation-2d-perp.png" style="width: 40%" class="img-center"/>
<p>
  First, the angle of rotation can be found by their cosine similarity:
  <d-math block> \theta = arccos(
    \frac{
      \langle \tilde{c}, \tilde{c}^{(new)} \rangle
    }{
      ||\tilde{c}|| \cdot ||\tilde{c}^{(new)}||
    }
  )</d-math>
  Next, to find the matrix form of the rotation, we need a convenient basis.
  Let <d-math>Q</d-math> be a change of (orthonormal) basis matrix in which the first two rows form the 2-subspace <d-math>span(\tilde{c}, \tilde{c}^{(new)})</d-math>.
  For example, we can let its first row to be <d-math>normalize(\tilde{c})</d-math>, second row to be its orthonormal complement <d-math>normalize(\tilde{c}^{(new)}_{\perp})</d-math> in <d-math>span(\tilde{c}, \tilde{c}^{(new)})</d-math>, and the remaining rows complete the whole space:
  <d-math block>
  \tilde{c}^{(new)}_{\perp} 
  := \tilde{c} - ||\tilde{c}|| \cdot cos \theta \frac{\tilde{c}^{(new)}}{||\tilde{c}^{(new)}||}
  </d-math>

  <d-math block>
    Q :=
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \cdots normalize(\tilde{c}) \cdots \\
    \cdots normalize(\tilde{c}^{(new)}_{\perp}) \cdots \\
    P
    \end{bmatrix}
  </d-math>
  where <d-math>P</d-math> completes the remaining space.

  Making use of <d-math>Q</d-math>, we can find the matrix that rotates the plane <d-math>span(\tilde{c}, \tilde{c}^{(new)})</d-math> by the angle <d-math>\theta</d-math>:
  <d-math block>
    \rho = Q^T
    \begin{bmatrix}
    cos \theta& sin \theta&  0&  0& \cdots\\
    -sin \theta& cos \theta&  0&  0& \cdots\\
    0& 0&  \\ 
    \vdots& \vdots& & I& \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    Q
    =: Q^T R_{1,2}(\theta) Q
  </d-math>
  The new Grand Tour matrix is the matrix product of the original <d-math>GT</d-math> and <d-math>\rho</d-math>:
  <d-math>
    GT^{(new)} := GT \cdot \rho
  </d-math>
  Now we should be able to see the connection between axis mode and data point mode.
  In data point mode, finding <d-math>Q</d-math> can be done by Grand-Schmidt: Let the first basis be <d-math>\tilde{c}</d-math>, find the orthogonal component of <d-math>\tilde{c}^{(new)}</d-math> in <d-math>span(\tilde{c}, \tilde{c}^{(new)})</d-math>, repeatedly take a random vector, find its orthogonal component to the span of the current basis vectors and add it to the basis set. 
  In axis mode, the <d-math>i^{th}</d-math>-row-first Grand-Schmidt does the rotation and change of basis in one step.

<h3>(CARLOS MOVED THIS BUT DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT IT) From Basis to Instances: Extending Direct Manipulations</h3>
<p>
  We tackle the second problem by allowing users to directly manipulate a subset of <em>points</em>.
</p>
<p> 
  Unlike the softmax layer, there is one problem with axis handles in hidden layers.
  Even though we preprocessed hidden layer activations (we chose up to 45 principle components through PCA) so that their dimensionality is at a manageable size for the Grand Tour, the axes lines can still make a hairball, and more importantly, these axes in hidden layers are not as meaningful as in the softmax case. 
  <!-- Unlike the softmax (or pre-softmax) where each axis represents a label class, in hidden layers, one may need some indirect ways (e.g. feature visualization <d-cite key="olah2017feature"></d-cite>) to understand the semantics. -->
  <!-- But even we used some feature visualization techniques, these derived meanings are hard to remember or encode in the Grand Tour.  -->
  Thus we should not have axis handles anymore.
  Instead, we can regard <em>data points</em> as handles this time. 
  In the figure above, we can brush a subset of data point, an orange circle at their centroid will show up and we use it as a handle to change the projection. 
  It is worth emphasizing that manipulations on data points are more general, because axis handles can be regarded as special data points as well.
  Moreover, they are applicable in even higher dimensions where axis handles are too many and/or have less semantics.
  We will cover how it works in <a href="#technical-details">technical details</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To summarize, by observing the invariance in Grand Tour, we simplified linear transformations in neural networks by removing their rotational components.
  To tackle the hairball effect when the dimensionality is large, we removed axis handles and directly manipulation points instead.
  We want to emphasize again that when axes have a clear semantics and there is only a few of them, like in the softmax layer of a 10-class dataset, we should use the axes. 
  In other cases, we should directly manipulate data points because either the axes may not be as interpretable as the softmax (e.g. intermediate layers), and/or there can be too many dimensions which has a hairball effect (e.g. a softmax layer of a 1000-class classification problem).

  When the <d-math>l^{th}</d-math> layer is a ReLU function, the output activation is <d-math>X^{l} = ReLU(X^{l-1})</d-math>. Since ReLU does not change the dimensionality and the function is taken coordinate wise, we can animate the transition by a simple linear interpolation: for a time parameter <d-math>t \in [0,1]</d-math>,
  <d-math block>
    X^{(l-1) \to l}(t) := (1-t) X^{l-1} + t X^{l}

  Linear Layers
</h4>
<div id='div-linear' class=''>
  Linear layers can seem complicated with a inappropriate basis. 
  For example, if <d-math>X^{l} = X^{l-1} M</d-math> where <d-math>M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}</d-math> is the matrix of a linear transformation, then it has a singular value decomposition (SVD):
  <d-math block>M = U \Sigma V^T</d-math>
  where <d-math>U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}</d-math> and <d-math>V^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}</d-math> are orthogonal, <d-math>\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}</d-math> is diagonal.
  For arbitrary <d-math>U</d-math> and <d-math>V^T</d-math>, the transformation on <d-math>X^{l-1}</d-math> is a composition of a rotation (<d-math>U</d-math>), scaling (<d-math>\Sigma</d-math>) and another rotation (<d-math>V^T</d-math>), which can look complicated. 
  However, when thinking about these actions in Grand Tour which is rotations, we notice that <d-math>U</d-math> and <d-math>V^T</d-math> will have no significance in it - they are just another two rotations to the view.
  Hence, instead of showing <d-math>M</d-math>, we should animate <d-math>\Sigma</d-math> only.
  <d-math>\Sigma</d-math> is a coordinate-wise scaling, so we can animate it similar to the ReLU after the proper change of basis.
  Given <d-math>X^{l} = X^{l-1} U \Sigma V^T</d-math>, we have
  <d-math block>
    (X^{l}V) = (X^{l-1}U)\Sigma
  </d-math>
  For a time parameter <d-math>t \in [0,1]</d-math>,
  <d-math block>
    X^{(l-1) \to l}(t) := (1-t) (X^{l-1}U) + t (X^{l}V)
  </d-math>

<h4 class="clickable clickable-active" onclick="toggle(event, '#div-conv')">
  Convolutional Layers
</h4>
<div id='div-conv' class=''>
  Convolutional layers can be represented as special linear layers.
  With a change of representation, we can animate a convolutional layer like the previous section.
  For 2D convolutions this change of representation involves flattening the input and output, and repeating the kernel pattern in a sparse matrix <d-math>M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}</d-math>, where <d-math>m</d-math> and <d-math>n</d-math> are the dimensionalities of the input and output respectively.
  This change of representation is only practical for a small dimensionality (e.g. up to 1000), since we need to solve SVD for linear layers.
  However, the singular value decomposition of multi-channel 2D convolutions can be computed efficiently <d-cite key="sedghi2018singular"></d-cite>, which can be then be directly used for alignment.

  Max-pooling Layers
</h4>
<div id='div-maxpool' class=''>
  Animating max-pooling layers can be tricky since its not linear <d-footnote>A max-pooling layer is piece-wise linear</d-footnote> or coordinate-wise.
  We approximate it by average-pooling. 
  Similar to convolutional layers, we find the matrix form of average-pooling and use its SVD to align the view before and after this layer.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Although the Grand Tour is not a perfect solution for high-dimensional data visualization, the examples above highlight the importance of ensuring that the properties of the phenomenon we want to visualize are in fact respected by the visualization method. As powerful as t-SNE and UMAP are, they often fail to offer the correspondences we need, and such correspondences can come, surprisingly, from relatively simple methods like the ones we presented.
